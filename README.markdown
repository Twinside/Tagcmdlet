=========

Manipulate media tags (like mp3 song information) within the powershell.

Installation
------------
Compile the project, go to `Tagcmdlet\obj\Release` and copy everything in `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowershell\Modules\TagCmdlet`. The next thing is to put `import-module tagcmdlet` somewhere in your powershell profile.

Build
-----
Open Visual Studio 2010, open the solution, build it, done.

Todo
----
 - Fix documentation which seem broken with powershell 2.0
 - Fix type information which is broken.
